# Expense-Tracker
This lets you add, edit, or delete expenses and provides the total.

This project uses the local storage api of the web browser and is an example of using the create, read, use, and delete (CRUD) methodology. 
Items in the list are added dynamically by the user and each item added can also be edited without being deleted. Once edited the total is then updated accordingly.
